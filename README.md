s6rc-overlay

s6rc-overlay is a collection statically-compiled binairies and scripts aimed at easing building of containers that requires complex setup.

It is heavily inspired by [s6-overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay/) but uses [skarnet's s6-rc](http://www.skarnet.org/software/s6-rc/) for controlling setup and service dependencies.
